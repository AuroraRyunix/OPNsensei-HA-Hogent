# Project 3 — Linux & DNS

## 1. Scenario
You just joined a “medium-sized IT company,” which is corporate speak for too poor for real engineers but too big for one guy with a screwdriver.
Management discovered that Windows licenses aren’t free. Genius.

So now you get to migrate everything to Linux.
Why you? Because you once said “I installed Ubuntu once.”
Your task list of joy:
- Replace Windows File Server + ADDS → Samba
- Replace Windows DNS/DHCP → BIND + ISC DHC
- Replace IIS → Nginx
- Replace firewall → OPNSense
- Replace your will to live → Multiple distros simultaneously

Of course, you must use four different distros.
Why? Because nothing says “fun” like managing DEB, RPM, Alpine, and Mint all in one week.
Make a network diagram. It won’t help, but it looks professional.
